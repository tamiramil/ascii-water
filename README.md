# ASCII Water

A small experiment in simulating waves on a grid and visualizing them as a grid.  
Built with C++20 and SFML, this project represents surface dynamics through simple numerical methods and SFML-based rendering.

---

## What It Does

- Simulates 2D wave propagation on a square grid.
- Displays the wave as a grid in 3D space using SFML.
